The configuration file provides a way to specify some parameters

The configuration file is a Java Properties file and must adhere to that format.
(Any '\' must be doubled for escaping, so '\' would be '\\')
(Comments start with '#')

Values:

#  Same as command line option --limelight-web-app-url=
limelight.web.app.url=

#  The next property is only used when the submit program and the web app have access to the same file system.
#  When this is set properly, the locations of the files are sent to the web app, not the file contents.

#  Same as configured in the web app
limelight.upload.base.dir=
