Run ant__create_runnable_jar_importer.xml with ant:
  (in the same directory this file is in )

    ant -f ant__create_runnable_jar_importer.xml


The created runnable jar file will be in 'deploy' sub-folder.



What is changed:

A runnable JAR is created:

	A manifest with the Java main class used in the importer
