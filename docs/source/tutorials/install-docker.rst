=======================
Installing Docker
=======================
Many of these tutorials will assume Docker is installed on your system. Docker allows you to securely
run any software on your own system using the same environment, regardless of your own operating
system or other installed software. If Docker is not already installed on your system, see below
for instructions to install Docker on most major operating systems.

For more information about Docker, see `the official Docker website <https://www.docker.com/L>`_

Windows
===========
There are two ways to install Docker on Windows--the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) method and the
virtual machine (Hyper-V) method.

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) **(Recommended)**
--------------------------------------------------------
One of the latest capabilities of Windows to to natively install Linux running right alongside Windows at the same
time. This opens the Linux ecosystem up to Windows users and makes installing and using many Linux applications
much simpler.

To enable WSL 2 on your Windows 10 installation,
`follow these directions from Microsoft <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`_. Scroll down
to the **Manual Installation Steps** section and follow the instructions. Once you get to **Step 6** these instructions
will assume you have installed **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.

Once you have completed the installation, please view the :ref:`Linux` section below.

Virtual Machine (Hyper-V) Method
