Welcome to Limelight
=========================

**Limelight** is a web application for analyzing, visualizing, and sharing and bottom-up proteomics results.

   Discovery and visualization of uncharacterized drug-protein adducts using mass spectrometry. Riffle M,

Introduction
=============

**Limelight** is designed to provide you with the full-stack of proteomics results, regardless of which processing
pipeline you used to search your data. Full-stack means that you have access to the global views of your
data (such as statistically comparing conditions), to viewing lists of proteins and peptides, to individual PSMs
and spectra--all showing the native scores from whichever pipeline you used. Additionally, all native scores from
your pipeline are available to you for filtering--even when contrasting multiple searches that each used different
pipelines.


Tutorials for Running Pipeline
==================================
We have developed tutorials to accompany Riffle M, Hoopmann M, et al. (2021) that describe the process for
running the Magnum, Percolator, Limelight pipeline; and how to then perform the statistical test for finding
mods of interest in Limelight. Please see our :ref:`Tutorials Page <Tutorials>`
