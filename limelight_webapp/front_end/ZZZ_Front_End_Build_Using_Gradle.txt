ZZZ_Front_End_Build_Using_Gradle.txt

This is the directory for the front end build using Gradle which uses Handlebars Precompile and Webpack.

Everything built here will be included into the war.

  * This build.gradle script will copy (after building)  
    the contents of 'webpack_build_output' to the parent directory
    to where it is needed to build the war.
    
  
Start by following ZZZ_Front_End_First_Install_Things.txt


Start in this project by running (At beginning and after 'package.json' changes):
		(It is best to remove subdir 'node_modules' before running this command)

    npm install
    
Then to build front end: run 'gradle'

    gradle will run handlebars in multiple directories and then webpack

    webpack can be run directly by running:

		npx webpack --config webpack.config.js

    
    *****  Important:
    
      Folder 'node_modules' must be in .gitignore since the contents are sometimes different
                            between Windows and Linux and Mac.
