---
Limelight is designed to support the native results from any bottom up proteomics pipeline. Results are converted to limelight XML
using a converter and any data represented as limelight XML may be uploaded into limelight. Converters currently
exist for Comet, Crux, Magnum, MetaMorpheus, MSFragger, Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP), and more. To learn more about converting
and uploading results, see limelights's [upload documentation](http://limelight.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/upload_data.html){:target="_blank"}.
